# code-quiz

this code quiz is supposed to take infortmation and keep it in local storage.
we had to subtract 15 seconds from the timer for ever wrong answer. 
we had to have the user input their initial and save to local storage.
we had to make sure that we had a start button that took the user to the quiz in itself.
then the timer starts once you've hit start and it ends when you have completed it.
